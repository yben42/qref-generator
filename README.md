# QREF Generator 

A lightweight web app that generates **Quick Reference (QREF) flight sheets** for fast reference in training and flight simulation contexts.

The goal is to reduce lookup time and present essential flight information in a clear, printable format.

## What it does
- Generates structured QREF sheets from user input
- Formats critical flight data for quick scanning
- Designed for speed, clarity, and minimal distraction
- Useful for training, planning, or simulation scenarios

## Why I built this
My bestfriend is a Pilot and, while studying for the PPL exam, I wanted to create something that would help him. Pilots and aviation students rely on quick reference sheets to reduce cognitive load during high-workload phases.  
This project explores how a simple web interface can standardize and speed up QREF creation.
